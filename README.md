Lost Reader Database 

Problem Statement/Proposal: 
Libraries are complicated. There are many things to keep track of including book location, book information, checkout status, etc. Not to mention the various other items found in libraries like movies, CDs, and laptop chargers to name a few. Our proposal is to create a library organization and management database application. This would allow librarians to keep track of everything that goes on in the library and help library members locate books/items by using additional location markers, such as the cardinal direction system. This command-line application would also provide library members with a profile that can be used to reserve books and create wishlists. A database is necessary for this application because of the large number of books and other items stored within a library.
